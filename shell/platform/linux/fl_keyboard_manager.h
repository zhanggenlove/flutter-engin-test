 * - Keyboard: Dispatch to the embedder responder and the channel responder
 *   simultaneously. After both responders have responded (asynchronously), the
 *   event is considered handled if either responder handles it.
 * - Text input: Events are sent to IM filter (usually owned by
 *   `TextInputPlugin`) and are handled synchronously.
 * - Redispatching: Events are inserted back to the system for redispatching.
